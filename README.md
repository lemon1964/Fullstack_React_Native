# Full Stack Open Course Assignments, Part 10

This repository contains projects from **Part 10** of the Full Stack Open course, built using the **React Native** framework.

## Project Overview

These projects were developed on **macOS 11**, which does not support Android or iOS emulators. Testing and preview were done using the **Expo Go** mobile app on an iOS device, as well as in a web browser. **Expo SDK version 51** was used to ensure compatibility.

### **rate-repository-app**

This app is a starter project from Section 1, *Introduction to React Native*, and was initialized using the Expo framework with the `create-expo-app` command.

### **rate-repository-app-b**

This is a continuation of the **rate-repository-app**, part of Section 2, *React Native Basics*. The app uses `NativeRouter` and `BrowserRouter`, allowing navigation between the "Repositories" and "Sign In" pages on both mobile devices and in a web browser. It features a repository list, as well as a basic sign-in page for testing the login functionality.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later recommended)
- **Expo CLI** (to install, run `npm install -g expo-cli`)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing dependencies)
- **Expo Go** app for testing on mobile devices
